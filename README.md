We (a friend and I) tracked down the website (discordapp.chat), looked through all the source code and found that the website takes you to a form where the victim enters their credit card details which are then sent to the hacker's Discord server via webhook.

This scam originated (as far as we know) from Discord users accounts being hacked and the hacker sending involuntary DMs through the victims' accounts to their friends. We suspect this could be hacked via the browsers cookies, however, we aren't fully sure.

**Here is a list of all the domains we know that have been associated with this scam:**
- discordapp.chat
- discordapp.gifts
